"""Deep Q learning graph

The functions in this file can are used to create the following functions:

======= act ========

    Function to chose an action given an observation

    Parameters
    ----------
    observation: object
        Observation that can be feed into the output of make_obs_ph
    stochastic: bool
        if set to False all the actions are always deterministic (default False)
    update_eps_ph: float
        update epsilon a new value, if negative not update happens
        (default: no update)

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor of dtype tf.int64 and shape (BATCH_SIZE,) with an action to be performed for
    every element of the batch.


======= act (in case of parameter noise) ========

    Function to chose an action given an observation

    Parameters
    ----------
    observation: object
        Observation that can be feed into the output of make_obs_ph
    stochastic: bool
        if set to False all the actions are always deterministic (default False)
    update_eps_ph: float
        update epsilon to a new value, if negative no update happens
        (default: no update)
    reset_ph: bool
        reset the perturbed policy by sampling a new perturbation
    update_param_noise_threshold_ph: float
        the desired threshold for the difference between non-perturbed and perturbed policy
    update_param_noise_scale_ph: bool
        whether or not to update the scale of the noise for the next time it is re-perturbed

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor of dtype tf.int64 and shape (BATCH_SIZE,) with an action to be performed for
    every element of the batch.


======= train =======

    Function that takes a transition (s,a,r,s') and optimizes Bellman equation's error:

        td_error = Q(s,a) - (r + gamma * max_a' Q(s', a'))
        loss = huber_loss[td_error]

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs_t: object
        a batch of observations
    action: np.array
        actions that were selected upon seeing obs_t.
        dtype must be int32 and shape must be (batch_size,)
    reward: np.array
        immediate reward attained after executing those actions
        dtype must be float32 and shape must be (batch_size,)
    obs_tp1: object
        observations that followed obs_t
    done: np.array
        1 if obs_t was the last observation in the episode and 0 otherwise
        obs_tp1 gets ignored, but must be of the valid shape.
        dtype must be float32 and shape must be (batch_size,)
    weight: np.array
        imporance weights for every element of the batch (gradient is multiplied
        by the importance weight) dtype must be float32 and shape must be (batch_size,)

    Returns
    -------
    td_error: np.array
        a list of differences between Q(s,a) and the target in Bellman's equation.
        dtype is float32 and shape is (batch_size,)

======= update_target ========

    copy the parameters from optimized Q function to the target Q function.
    In Q learning we actually optimize the following error:

        Q(s,a) - (r + gamma * max_a' Q'(s', a'))

    Where Q' is lagging behind Q to stablize the learning. For example for Atari

    Q' is set to Q once every 10000 updates training steps.
